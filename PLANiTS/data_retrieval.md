# ðŸŒ¿ Using the PLANiTS Database for Metagenomics Analyses

The [PLANiTS database](https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS) is a curated reference dataset of plant ITS sequences, suitable for taxonomic assignment in DNA metabarcoding workflows, particularly those targeting the **Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)** region of nuclear ribosomal DNA.

This guide explains how to download and use PLANiTS as a reference database for QIIME2 and other tools.

## ðŸ“¥ 1. Download the Database

1. Visit the GitHub repository:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS](https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS)

2. Download the latest release from the "Releases" section:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS/releases](https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS/releases)

   Youâ€™ll find a ZIP file (e.g., `PLANiTS_29-03-2020.zip`) containing:
   - `PLANiTS_full.fasta`: Full-length ITS sequences  
   - `PLANiTS1.fasta`: ITS1 region  
   - `PLANiTS2.fasta`: ITS2 region  
   - Corresponding taxonomy files (e.g., `PLANiTS_full.txt`)

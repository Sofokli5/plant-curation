# Guidelines for Adding New Reference Databases to nf-core/ampliseq

This document outlines the final step to generate the nescecary files to add a new reference sequence database (e.g. for DADA2, QIIME2, or Kraken2) into the **nf-core/ampliseq** pipeline as an available option.  

## 1. Create fasta files

Run the provided R script (`files4ampliseq.R`) to create the two necessary files for **ampliseq**. The input files of that script are produced during the curation process described during (`02.curation.md`) workflow.

```bash
Rscript files4ampliseq.R
```

**Output files:**  
- `taxonomy_headers.fasta.gz`
- `id_species.fasta.gz`

## 2. Making your Reference part of nf-core/ampliseq. 

For actually submitting your custom databases on **nf-core/ampliseq** to be available with the tool by anyone we strongly advise you to visit PR [#883](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq/pull/883) (which added `plantae-bold-trnL`) and nf-core pipeline standards.
